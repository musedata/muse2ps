         Documentation for constructing the muse2ps program
       ------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:black; background-color:orange">I. Prologue</span>

So I hate to say it, but there seems to be very little documentation on
how to construct the muse2ps command-line program.  Searching through
the diary, I see that we implemented three <span style="color:black; background-color:#cf5c5c">new</span> zbex instructions as part
of the development process: getC, getd, and pute.  These instructions are
fully documented in the <span style="color:black; background-color:#cf5c5c">help</span> file.

  1) <span style="color:black; background-color:#cf5c5c">pute</span>   In Dmuse, pute is the same as putc; but in the terminal
     environment, pute sends output not to stdout but to stderr.
     This distinction is necessary, because in the terminal environment,
     stdout is redirected to an output file.  And we don't want error
     messages going into that file.

  2) <span style="color:black; background-color:#cf5c5c">getd</span>   This gets a time stamp string from Linux.  Handy and consistant.

  3) <span style="color:black; background-color:#cf5c5c">getC</span>   This instruction gets the <span style="color:black; background-color:#cf5c5c">last entered value</span> of the -c
     command_line variable.  For example, try this program:

zz
Current Library is j:/release/internet/linux/muse2ps.dir/workfiles
Program file?

Input program from terminal.
     str line.80
     getC line
     putc ~line
     run
** S=4, P=10, L=240, M=431 **
=z18fj
Ready for program

     The last entered command-line option was apparently '=z18fj'

     Now try the program, using the command: zz -c'Hello World'

zz -c'Hello World'
Current Library is j:/release/internet/linux/muse2ps.dir/workfiles
Program file?

Input program from terminal.
     str line.80
     getC line
     putc ~line
     run
** S=4, P=10, L=240, M=431 **
Hello World
Ready for program

<span style="color:black; background-color:orange">II.  The compile process for muse2ps</span>

1) get au-ms-ps in the form you want.

   Library: j:/release/internet/linux/muse2ps/workfiles

   To to this, you need to get the program running.  Verify that
   it does the right thing.  Then make the modifications you
   want, and check it again.  You are not done, yet.  You then
   need to make the modifications in the procedures (this makes
   it permanent), and run the makefile program.  Re-load
   au-ms-ps to verify that the changes were made.

   My technique for doing this is to make changes in au-ms-ps
   and put the result in save.tmp   Then I run the makefile.z
   program to construct reconstruct the old au-ms-ps.  I run
   the <span style="color:black; background-color:#cf5c5c">diff</span> program on these two, and then progressively
   remove differences by updating the various procedure
   files, and going through the process again.

2) The au-ms-ps program compiles to the Dmuse environment
   version.  To get it ready for muse2ps, you need to change
   the DMUSE define value to "0"   <span style="color:black; background-color:orange">Important</span>.

3) run zcmp to get the .w form of au-ms-ps

4) run bytecomp.z on au-ms-ps.w --&gt; temp1

5) run dictcomp.z on temp1 --&gt; small

6) run tostring.z on small --&gt; screen output

7) Now switch to the c:/home/wbh/develop/m2ps library

8) The file to fix here is zfun32.c   In addition to copying
   the large string from (5), you will need insert the size
   number in two places:  1) in the memcpy instruction at
   the end, and 2) where the "size" variable is set (approx.
   line 175).

9) Now you are ready to compile the executable muse2ps program.
   Do this by running "make".

10) The command for running the program looks like this:

    cat &lt;source file&gt; | ./muse2ps '=&lt;command options&gt;' &gt; &lt;output file&gt;

11) The command for viewing the output is this:

    gs -sDEVICE=x11 -r100 &lt;output file&gt;

    The -r option is for resolution.
