The muse2ps program is a command-line version of the autoset, mskpage
and pspage programs which usually are run inside of the dmuse editor
using the built-in zbex language interpreter.  The muse2ps program
contains a stand-alone interpreter for these zbex programs, along
with the fonts necessary to print music as PostScript files.

See the [main webpage for muse2ps](http://muse2ps.ccarh.org) for
detailed documentation on running the program.

The [bin] directory contains pre-compiled version of dmuse for
linux, OS X and Windows.

Sample data can be found in the [src/tests] directory.  All of the
Beethoven string quartets are available in MuseData format
[here](https://github.com/musedata/beethoven-quartets).
