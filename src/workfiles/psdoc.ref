&dA &d@          Program to print, display or render into .ps format

&dA 
&dA &d@    I. Program History 
&dA 
&dA &d@    The earliest examples of page specific i-files were generated 
&dA &d@    in the process of typesetting Eleanor Field's &dCThematic Catalog&d@ 
&dA &d@    &dCof the Music of Benedetto and Alessandro Marcello&d@.  We needed 
&dA &d@    to have the musical examples in a format that captured most of 
&dA &d@    the intellegence involved in music typesetting, so that changes 
&dA &d@    (improvements) to the output could be made with hand corrections 
&dA &d@    to the "file" without having to add intellegence to the typesetting 
&dA &d@    program.  
&dA &d@     
&dA &d@    Once the i-file format became established, and a prototype of 
&dA &d@    this program was written, it became possible to typeset and 
&dA &d@    print scores and parts of music.  The first major project was 
&dA &d@    the production of a score and parts for Handel's oratorio 
&dA &d@    &dCSusanna&d@, in 1989.  At that time, the Center's programs were 
&dA &d@    running on the old Ibycus system, and there was no provision 
&dA &d@    in zbex for the graphical display of information on a screen.  
&dA &d@    The first music printing program was called &dCpskpage&d@.  It used 
&dA &d@    bitmap fonts that were downloaded to an HP LaserJet and printed 
&dA &d@    slurs using the graphics capabilities of HP's PCL3 printer 
&dA &d@    language.  
&dA 
&dA &d@    In 1989, the Center began experimenting with a new system, 
&dA &d@    running on an HPUX workstation.  All data was transferred to 
&dA &d@    this system in 1990, and the old Ibycus system was shut down 
&dA &d@    and dismantled.  A certain amount of data was lost in the 
&dA &d@    transfer.
&dA 
&dA &d@    In early 1991, WBH began work on a DOS based environment called 
&dA &d@    TENW, which eventually grew to become the Center's operating 
&dA &d@    environment.  A new version of ibex, we all zbex, was designed 
&dA &d@    and implemented, and TENW became TENX and then simply "the 
&dA &d@    monster."  By early 1992, zbex acquired the capability of 
&dA &d@    displaying graphical images on the screen.  Borrowing from the 
&dA &d@    logic of the music printing program, the display program, called 
&dA &d@    &dCdskpage&d@, displayed music on the screen using bitmap fonts and 
&dA &d@    bitmap graphics.  Very soon afterward, pskpage and dskpage were 
&dA &d@    combined into one program using the conditional compile feature 
&dA &d@    of zbex.  
&dA &d@     
&dA &d@    The further history of the program is best captured in the 
&dA &d@    revision documentation below.  It is worth noting here that 
&dA &d@    the program picked up two major capabilites recently.  In 
&dA &d@    November, 2008, the ability to output .ps postscript files 
&dA &d@    was added (pspage), and in November, 2009, code was added to 
&dA &d@    enable the display of a "scrolling" page of music (dscroll).

&dA &d@    PC Version 2.0  (rev. 01/01/95) 
&dA 
&dA &d@       This program will print or display pages of music from page 
&dA &d@       files in score format.  The program asks for the library and 
&dA &d@       number of pages, then proceeds to print these one page at a 
&dA &d@       time.  Pages consist of one or more systems, each of which is 
&dA &d@       handled independently by the print program.  This means that 
&dA &d@       systems can be moved from page to page with window editor 
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA11-11-93&d@:  Attribute records are ignored 
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA03-13-94&d@:  Size of superdata array increased to accommodate 
&dA &d@    many notes under a beam.  Former size of second dimension was 24.  This 
&dA &d@    meant that the maximum number of notes was 12.  The third dimension is 
&dA &d@    now set by the defined variable SUPERSIZE (set below).  SUPERSIZE must 
&dA &d@    be twice the number of notes to be accomodated.  Also, it appears that 
&dA &d@    certain array variables related to the production of beams must have 
&dA &d@    one of their dimensions increased.  The new dimension will be defined 
&dA &d@    as BEAMNOTES.  
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA05-04-94&d@:  Printout portion of setbeam adjusted to accommodate 
&dA &d@    unusually short stems.
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA06-15-94&d@:  Program will recognize repeaters as legitimate beam 
&dA &d@    components.  The code for a repeater is "6" in beamcode.  Repeaters are 
&dA &d@    constructed from "hooks".  There is a certain amount of vertical and 
&dA &d@    horizontal shifting involved.  I have not yet found a way to incorporate 
&dA &d@    these "magic" numbers in hpar(.) and vpar(.).  This problem must be 
&dA &d@    solved at some point.
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA09-13-94&d@:  The second numerical parameter of a text (T) record 
&dA &d@    specifies the text line number, if it is 10 or less; otherwise, it 
&dA &d@    specifies the vertical offset of the specific word of text.  
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA11-05-94&d@:  Provision made for displaying slurs longer than 800 
&dA &d@    dots.  
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA01-01-95&d@:  Program can be used to generate versions for

&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA02-25-95&d@:  Program was initially set up to print a single line 
&dA &d@    of text under music.  To implement multiple lines (strophic), we need 
&dA &d@    to have such variables as xbyte, dyoff, uxstart, and backloc be arrays 
&dA &d@    since text lines are essentially independent.

&dA &d@    Note from the author, Walter B. Hewlett 
&dA &d@    --------------------------------------- 
&dA &d@    In the spring of 1997, I was elected to the Board of Overseers of 
&dA &d@    Harvard College.  My father suffered his second stroke in November 
&dA &d@    of 1996, and managing his affairs required an increasing amount of 
&dA &d@    my time over the next 4 years.  In 1999, Agilent was spun off from 
&dA &d@    Hewlett Packard.  I remained on the Boards of both companies.  In 
&dA &d@    1999, we also conducted a search for a new president of the Hewlett 
&dA &d@    Foundation.  The Flora Family Foundation was established about this 
&dA &d@    time.  My father died in January of 2001.  I wrote some 300 personal 
&dA &d@    letters in answer to letters we received from friends and admirers.  
&dA &d@    In May of 2001, Carly Fiorina and the HP Board decided to explore 
&dA &d@    a merger with Compaq Computer.  The details were hammered out over 
&dA &d@    the summer, and the merger was announced one week before 9/11/2001.  
&dA &d@    In November of that year, the Hewlett Foundation decided to vote 
&dA &d@    against the merger and I decided to mount an opposition campaign.  
&dA &d@    The campaign was intense and lasted until March, 2002.  We lost on a 
&dA &d@    vote of 48.5% to 51.5%.  After an unsuccessful Delaware court challange
&dA &d@    of the results, the merger was completed in May of 2002.  At that 
&dA &d@    time, I was voted off the HP Board.                           
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA08/28/02&d@:  Added a second meaning to "X" records.  With only 
&dA &d@                          two fields, this record changes the value of 
&dA &d@                          notesize (assuming the new value is legal).  
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA09/21/02&d@:  Trying to remove "magic numbers" from settie.    
&dA &d@                          There are four new horizontal parameters.  
&dA &d@                          These are put into hpar(60) to hpar(63).  
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA09/22/02&d@:  Adding provisions to increase number of note     
&dA &d@                          sizes.  Size-18 being added.  Increased size 
&dA &d@                          of parameter files for tie selection. (tpar files)
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA04/20/03&d@:  Implementing post adjustment to tie position

&dA &d@                          
&dA &d@    Revision &dA05/19/03&d@:  Adding new rules for the placement of secondary beams
&dA &d@                          in the case of mixed stem directions on the grandstaff.
&dA &d@                          
&dA &d@    Revision &dA05/26/03&d@:  Fixing problem with grandstaff repeat dots.  They need
&dA &d@                          to print on both staves:  Case I: when the barline     
&dA &d@                          appears as an Object record, with repeat dot Subobjects,
&dA &d@                          and  Case II: when a forward repeat is thrown to the next
&dA &d@                          system (i.e., Bar type: B 25).  
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA08/26/03&d@:  In an older version of this program hpar(15) was set at 
&dA &d@                          run-time to the position where text hyphons start on 
&dA &d@                          a new line.  When multiple strophs were introduced,
&dA &d@                          hpar(15) was discarded (not set), but remained in 
&dA &d@                          the code to set hyphons.  New variable ibackloc(.) 
&dA &d@                          has be added to replace the old hpar(15).  It is set
&dA &d@                          to the values of backloc(.) as read in the Line record.
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA08/28/03&d@:  There is a problem with multiple strophs on a line.  Mskpage,
&dA &d@                          as currently written, only sets one copy of the variables
&dA &d@                          uxstart and backloc, even when there is more than one
&dA &d@                          stroph.  This is O.K., since uxstart and backloc are most
&dA &d@                          likely going to be the same for all strophs.  Dskpage must
&dA &d@                          be alert to this fact, however, and must fill the uxstart
&dA &d@                          backloc and ibackloc arrays appropriately when this situation
&dA &d@                          occurs.  
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA08/28/03&d@:  Needed to fix the way an underline was terminated by ttext = "~"
&dA &d@                          in the case where punctuation is present.  Essentually, the
&dA &d@                          "~" command functions in two parts: (1) It causes an underline
&dA &d@                          to terminate before the note to which the "~" is attached, and
&dA &d@                          (2) it extends the underline some distance beyond that note.
&dA &d@                          Where punctuation is present, it must not be printed with
&dA &d@                          operation (1), but rather with operation (2).  
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA08/31/03&d@:  In the case where a stroph phrase ends with an extension line
&dA &d@                          and then is not continued, (e.g., when there is a repeat in 
&dA &d@                          middle of a line) we need a way to signal the end of the       
&dA &d@                          extension line; otherwise, it will continue to the end of the 
&dA &d@                          piece.  If the stage2 file indicates an end to the extension
&dA &d@                          line with the code "|&" (& representing the non-existant text),
&dA &d@                          then this program will treat the "&" as = "no text"
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA09/14/03&d@:  A 10th field has be added to Line (L) records.  It is always 
&dA &d@                          set to zero by mskpage.  This field provides an additional 
&dA &d@                          offset to the height of figured harmonies.  It must be   
&dA &d@                          changed manually.                                              
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA10/01/03&d@:  Adding the condition on "W" type subobjects that if the font
&dA &d@                          (variable z) is zero, no word (text) is printed.  Print   
&dA &d@                          suggestions can then be used to blank out certain instructions
&dA &d@                          in scores or parts.  
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA10/23/03&d@:  Modifying slightly the way in which dotted slurs are constructed
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA11/06/03&d@:  Two modifications to how the vertical height of figure continuation
&dA &d@                          lines is calculated.  (1) If the height of figures is altered
&dA &d@                          for an entire line by a non-zero figoff(.), then the height of
&dA &d@                          figure continuation lines must also be altered by this amount.
&dA &d@                          (2) It is possible to alter the height of figures manually, and
&dA &d@                          we need this same ability for figure continuation lines.  This
&dA &d@                          requires the addition of an (optional) 7th Field in the 
&dA &d@                          Figure continuation superobject, which is defined to be the
&dA &d@                          additional vertical displacement from the default height.
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA11/11/03&d@:  DSKPAGE can now be used to view .MPG files (or any set of pages
&dA &d@                          with a standard extension.  The catch is that all files to be
&dA &d@                          viewed must have the same extension.  This could be fixed in  
&dA &d@                          the future.  Also, a graceful exit was added for the case 
&dA &d@                          where no page numbers were found.  
&dA

&dA &d@                          problem.       
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA01/17/04&d@:  We needed to add a terminator to the font designation field
&dA &d@                          when it occurs in-line in text.  The terminator is the "|"
&dA &d@                          character, and needs to be removed at print/display time.
&dA 
&dA &d@    Revision &dA03/05/04&d@:  DSKPAGE, on occasion, may be asked to display text.  In some
&dA &d@                          cases, the text may need to be right justified.  The best  
&dA &d@                          way to do this is to provide for "in-line" space commands.
&dA &d@                          Since the charaters 131 to 141 are currently unused (and
&dA &d@                          un-printable) the idea is to implement the following 
&dA &d@                          (internal) representation: 
&dA &d@                               characters 131 to 139 = add 1 (to 9) dots of space
&dA &d@                                       character 140 = subtract one dot of space
&dA &d@                                       character 141 = subtract two dot of space
&dA &d@                          It should be stressed that this representation is internal 
&dA &d@                          to DSKPAGE.  The screen and printer never see these characters;
&dA &d@                          nor do they ever appear in a file to be displayed or printed.
&dA &d@                          The in-line commands that generate these characters are as
&dA &d@                          follows: (these will appear in files to be displayed/printed)
&dA &d@                            \! = add one dot of space     \& = add seven dots of space
&dA &d@                            \@ = add two dots of space    \* = add eight dots of space
&dA &d@                            \# = add three dots of space  \( = add nine dots of space
&dA &d@                            \$ = add four dots of space   \- = subtract one dot of space
&dA &d@                            \% = add five dots of space   \= = subtract two dots of space
&dA &d@                            \^ = add six dots of space

&dA &d@                          (e.g. notes, accidentals, etc.).  This necessitates the rewriting
&dA &d@                          of certain sections of the text output.  Also, the new word-join  
&dA &d@                          character contains its own pre-print backup command, removing
&dA &d@                          the need to use hpar(4).  Also, the way dskpage developed
&dA &d@                          historically, there were two procedures that set text: 
&dA &d@                          setwords and settext.  These have already been combined in
&dA &d@                          the hardcoded DMUSE version, but need to be combined here

&dA &d@    Revision &dA01/05/09&d@:  For our application, postscript files need to have 
&dA &d@                        a bounding box.  If there is a caption at the bottom 
&dA &d@                        of the page, the box should not include this.  If 
&dA &d@                        the page has a musical system, the left and right 
&dA &d@                        boundaries should be the staff line limits of the 
&dA &d@                        system.  If the left system boundary is > 220 dots,
&dA &d@                        the code should look for an instrument designation 
&dA &d@                        to the left of the system.  This position will 
&dA &d@                        determine the left side of the bounding box.
